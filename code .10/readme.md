# **Stack** and a _Queue_ Implementation (code challenge _10_)

## Challenge

- Implement a **Stack** and a **Queue**, By using a _Linked List_ as the underlying data storage mechanism.

## test code

![test](./image/code.10.test.PNG)

- Run tests with :
  - npm test

## time: O(1)

## space: O(1)

## API

- Create Node and two LinkedList Classes for Stack and Queue.

- Within your Linked List (Stack) create a method (push, pop, peek, isEmpty).

- Within your Linked List (Queue) create a method (enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty).

- Use the method on Stack and Queue.
- Do tests to check the code

## Approach & Efficiency

- Read the lab and understand the problem domain "Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue"

- Thinking and search how to solve and deal with this issue

- Start writing the code
- Testing the code
