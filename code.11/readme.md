# Stack Queue Pseudo (lab 11)

[code_challenge_401](https://github.com/mr-atta/code_challenge_401)

### Code Challenge :

- Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

<br>

## Approach & Efficiency

- Read the lab and understand the problem domain "Implement a Queue using two Stacks."

- Thinking and search how to solve and deal with this issue

- Start writing the code
- Testing the code

<br>

## API

### stack

- push(value) : adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- pop() : Removes the node from the top of the stack

### queue

- enqueue(value) : adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
- dequeue() : Removes the node from the front of the queue
- peek() : Returns the Value of the node located at the front of the queue
- isEmpty() : Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

<br>

## Big O

- enqueue

  - Time : O(1)
  - Space : O(1)

- dequeue
  - Time : O(n)
  - Space : O(n)
